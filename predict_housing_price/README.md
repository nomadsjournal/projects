## Predicting Housing Price Using Population Data
See how population change affects housing prices. 

## Background
Since the 2008 recession, the real estate market has been steadily recovering. 
While housing prices in the coastal cities have seen the most intense growth, 
the real estate markets in the Sun Belt cities have also been steadily growing. 

### Goals & Objectives
The recent growth in housing markets is due to a strong demand and a lack of supply. 
The cities that attract professionals will continue to see appreciation in the housing prices. 
Therefore, I want to see how the population change affects the housing prices. 

1. Predict 2017 home sale prices using population data
2. Determine the age groups that most influence the market

## Approach
#### Models Used
* Linear Regression
* Lasso & Ridge Regression
* Gradient Boosting

#### Python Packages
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn
* sklearn

#### Datasets
* "County population by age group, 2010-2017" from *[US Census Bureau](HTTPS://WWW.CENSUS.GOV)* 
* "Median home sale price by county" from *[Zillow Group](HTTPS://WWW.ZILLOW.COM/RESEARCH/HOME-SALES-METHODOLOGY-7733/)* 

## Project Description
Using the population data by age group and the median housing sale price from Zillow, I was able to predict 
the 2017 housing prices using regression models. You can see my results in the .pdf file attached in this folder.
